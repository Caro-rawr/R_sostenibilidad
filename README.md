# üìä R for Sustainability

**Materials and scripts from a course on Statistics and Mathematical Modeling of Socio-Ecological Systems in R**, developed in collaboration with [Dr. Yosune Miquelajauregui Graf](https://github.com/yosunemiquela).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: All course content (scripts, slides, and datasets) is written in Spanish.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

This repository includes a set of modules structured around key statistical and modeling concepts for socio-ecological systems. Each module is organized in folders containing:

- `Scripts/` ‚Äì R code used in class.
- `Slides/` ‚Äì Class presentations (PDF).
- `Data/` ‚Äì Datasets used in the examples.
- `Ejemplos/` ‚Äì Applied examples and practice cases.
